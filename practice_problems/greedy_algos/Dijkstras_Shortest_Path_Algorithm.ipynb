    "## Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm\n",
    "Suppose there is a graph with nodes, where each node represents a city. A few pair of nodes are connected to each other, with their distance labeled on the conneting edge, as shown in the figure below:\n",
    "<img style=\"float: center;height:250px;\" src=\"graph1.png\"><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the shortest path from a given source to destination node in the example above, a Greedy approach would be - *At each current node, keep track of the nearest neighbour. We can determine the path in the reverse order once we have a table of nearest neighbours (optimal previous nodes).* For example, C is the optimal previous node for E. This way, the shortest path from `A` to `E` would be `A --> D --> C --> E`, as shown below:\n",
    "<img style=\"float: center;height:250px;\" src=\"graph2.png\"><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "And, if we wish to print the distance of each node from `A`, then it would look like:\n",
    "<img style=\"float: center;height:250px;\" src=\"graph3.png\"><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the **Previous Optimal Node** is the \"best\" node which could lead us to the current node. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem\n",
    "Using Dijkstra's algorithm, find the shortest path to all the nodes starting from a given single source node.  You need to print the distance of each node from the given source node. For the example quoted above, the distance of each node from `A` would be printed as:<br>\n",

    "## The Algorithm\n",
    "1. Create a `result` dictionary. At the end of the program, `result` will have the shortest distance (value) for all nodes (key) in the graph. For our example, it will become as `{'A': 0, 'B': 5, 'C': 3, 'D': 2, 'F': 6, 'E': 4}`<br><br>\n",
    "1. Start with the source node. Distance from source to source (aka itself) is 0.  <br><br>\n",
    "1. The distance to all other nodes from the source is unknown initially, therefore set the initial distance to infinity.  <br><br>\n",
    "1. Create a set `unvisited` containing nodes that have not been visited. Initially, it will have all nodes in the graph.<br><br>\n",
    "1. Create a `path` dictionary that keeps track of the previous node (value) that can lead to the current node (key). At the end of the program, for our example, it would be `{'B': 'A', 'C': 'D', 'D': 'A', 'F': 'C', 'E': 'C'}`. <br><br>\n",
    "1. As long as `unvisited` is non-empty, repeat the following:\n",
    " - Find the unvisited node having the smallest known distance from the source node.  <br><br>\n",
    " - For the current node, find all the **unvisited neighbours**. For this, you have calculate the distance of each unvisited neighbour.  <br><br>\n",
    " - If the calculated distance of the **unvisited neighbour** is less than the already known distance in our `result` dictionary, update the shortest distance in the `result` dictionary. <br><br>\n",
    " - If there is an update in the `result` dictionary, you need to update the `path` dictionary as well, for the same key. <br><br>\n",
    " - Remove the current node from the `unvisited` set.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** - This implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm is not very efficient. Currently it has a *O(n^2)* time complexity. We will see a better version in the next lesson - \"Graph Algorithms\" with *O(nlogn)* time complexity."
