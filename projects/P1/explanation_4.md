For this problem I decided to recursively visit all subgroups of the current group if the user doesn't belong to the current group. To search for the user, I'm using binary search.

The time complexity is O(n log(n)), when simplied, where n is the number of users in a group.

The space complexity of the method is O(n log(n)), where n is the number of calls in our call stack generated by the binary_search() method.
