I chose a dictionary as the data store and a doubly linked list as the data structure for tracking which entry was least recently used to achieve O(1) get() and put()/set() operations. The dictionary allows for O(1) time complexity when retrieving, deleting, updating, and inserting values. The doubly linked list allows for O(1) time complexity when retrieving the least recently used entry since it'll be at the head, and close to O(1) time complexity when refreshing entries and moving them to the tail. The space complexity of my implementation is O(2n) or O(n), when simplified.
